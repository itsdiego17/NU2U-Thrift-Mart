# NU2U-Thrift-Mart
A thrift store website, located in Jackson, TN A thrift store website, located in Jackson, TN I worked with one of my classmates to make a website for her fathers store

My partners' father has a thrift store that neeeded a website. A website can always bring more clients to a local business and that's exactly what he need it. We had a lot of designs in mind, but we really didn't like how they ended up looking, so we grabbed a little bit from each of the websites and came out with the main website style.

Skills: We have advanced our skills and design by implementing javascript and php forms, where people can get in touch with the store. We used javascript for the maps, which it wasn't easy at first but after a few days of learning and understanding javascript a little bit more, we got a responsive map that shows the location of the store. Our video is from youtube, but at first it wasn't that responsive after we did research we made the youtube video responsive with some css, and it looks great too.

Color: We had two main colors in mind which are the main colors of the store, but they didn't make a good color scheme. So we had to add another color and drop the brown to a more light shade. This made a perfect contrast. We kept the font readable, it's a normal font but it looks great on the site.

Pics and Video: Our pictures where diffent size at first and resizing them without loosing resolution isn't easy. We used Photoshop for this, we took each picture and resize it to the same size so everything would look nice and neat. Our video is from youtube, but at first it wasn't that responsive after we did research we made the youtube video responsive.

Logo Creation: Our logo was kinda difficult to create, we didn't know exactly what to use. We went throught a lot of ideas but they always ended up looking simple and bad. So we decided to make a simple but usual logo, we went for a price tag and the name of the store. It's simple but it describes the store perfectly.

Psychology for Design Decision: A website it's for everyone to see and get information from, so that's why we kept or site simple and easy to use, any one could use this site. People is able to read everysigle thing in the site and its simple and easy to navigate through.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my site! (:
